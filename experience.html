          <h3>Nakhon Pathom Electricity Authority</h3>
          <p>"I had an internship at Nakhon Pathom Electricity Authority,
            and it was a very enjoyable experience.
            <br>The mentors were kind and quite approachable.
            Everyone taught me about the tools used in the department,
            as well as various electrical knowledge.
            They guided me on where to start if I wanted to pursue this line of work.
            It was a new and enriching experience for me because,
            in the department,<br>I was the only intern.
            I had the opportunity to do tasks on my own and try new things that I didn't think <br>I could do.
            Throughout the two-month period, I felt very happy"</p>
